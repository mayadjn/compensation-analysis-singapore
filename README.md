# Singapore Workforce & Salary Growth Analysis (2014-2025)

# Project Overview

This analysis examines the relationship between non-resident labor and salary growth across Singapore industries from 2015-2025 (2025 data covers Q1 only). The study addresses three key questions:

1. How has salary growth varied across industries in the past decade?
2. Is there correlation between non-resident workforce ratio and salary growth?
3. Which industries show highest dependency on non-resident labor?
